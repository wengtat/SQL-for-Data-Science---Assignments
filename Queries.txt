Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM attribute AS AttributeCount -- Answer = 10000
ii. Business table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM business AS BusinessCount -- Answer = 10000
iii. Category table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM category AS CategoryCount -- Answer = 10000
iv. Checkin table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM checkin AS CheckinCount -- Answer = 10000
v. elite_years table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM elite_years AS EliteYearsCount -- Answer = 10000
vi. friend table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM friend AS FriendCount -- Answer = 10000
vii. hours table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM hours AS HoursCount -- Answer = 10000
viii. photo table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM photo AS PhotoCount -- Answer = 10000
ix. review table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM review AS ReviewCount -- Answer = 10000
x. tip table = 			SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tip AS TipCount -- Answer = 10000
xi. user table = 		SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user AS UserCount -- Answer = 10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct id) FROM business -- Answer = 10000
ii. Hours = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct business_id) FROM hours -- Answer = 1562
iii. Category = 		SELECT COUNT(distinct business_id) FROM category -- Answer = 2643
iv. Attribute = 		SELECT COUNT(distinct business_id) FROM attribute -- Answer = 1115
v. Review = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct id) FROM Review -- Answer = 10000
vi. Checkin = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct business_id) FROM checkin -- Answer = 493
vii. Photo = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct id) FROM photo -- Answer = 10000
viii. Tip = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct user_id),COUNT(distinct business_id) FROM tip -- Answer = Unique user_id = 537, Unique business_id = 3979
ix. User = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct id) FROM user -- Answer = 10000
x. Friend = 			SELECT COUNT(distinct user_id), COUNT(distinct friend_id) FROM Friend -- Answer = Unique user_id = 11, Unique friend_id = 9415
xi. Elite_years = 		SELECT COUNT(distinct user_id) FROM Elite_years -- Answer = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: 'NO'

	Based on the selection of city = Las Vegas and category = shopping
	- The 4-5 star group tend to have shorter hours compared to 2-3 star group.
	- For instance, 2-3 stars have average of 14 hours vs average 8/9 hours for 4-5 stars group

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

	- Number of reviews varies depends on the hours duration.
	- For example, business duration of 8 hours has the highest review_count
	- Followed by business duration of 14 hours as the 2nd highest review_count
	- Business duration of 9 hours has the lowest review_count

	Based on finding from selection of city = Las Vegas and category = shopping
	- Different postal code will have different business hours
	- Postal code of 89161 with has the highest review_count at 32
	- Followed by postal code of 89121 
 


SELECT city, category		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
   What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
   List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:

   The business that are open status tend to have more reviews count than the one that are closed
	Closed: AVG(review_count) = 23.198
	Open: AVG(review_count) = 31.757

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT is_open, 
        	avg(review_count) 
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open

	+---------+-------------------+
	| is_open | avg(review_count) |

	|       1 |     31.7570754717 |
	+---------+-------------------+
 
         
ii. Difference 2:
         
    The business that are open status tend to have higher average star rating than the one that are closed
	Closed: AVG(stars) = 3.679
	Open: AVG(stars) = 3.520

SQL code used for analysis:

	SELECT is_open, 
        	avg(stars) 
	FROM business
	GROUP BY is_open

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

	- Predicting average star_rating for each unique business_id
	- Identify the trends/factors lead to successful business with high average star rating and review count
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
       
	- To help provide overall summary for each unique business_id and select the business with the highest overall rating and review count
	- To better help getting insight on which business has higher average star_rating
	- Then we can further analyze and identify the key factors leading to higher star_rating with high review count 
	- For instance, important data such as number of reviews, star rating of business, hours open, and of course location.
